      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <a name="Ingredients" />
        <ul>
          <li>12 oz fettuccine pasta
          <li> 2 tablespoons olive oil </li>
          <li> 1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons butter </li>
          <li> 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts </li>
          <li> 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, divided </li>
          <li> 1 1/2 teaspoon fresh ground pepper, divided </li>
          <li> 3 cloves garlic, very finely chopped </li>
          <li> 1 1/2 tablespoons flour </li>
          <li> 2 cups heavy cream </li>
          <li> 3/4 cup grated Parmesan, plus more for topping if desired </li>
          <li> 2 tablespoons chopped parsley, for garnish (optional) </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <a name="Directions" />
        <ol>
          <li> Cook and drain pasta according to package directions.</li>

          <li> Add olive oil to a cast-iron grill pan over high heat.
          Add 2 tablespoons butter to hot pan, then quickly add chicken
          breasts to the pan, seasoning with 1 teaspoon each of the salt
          and pepper.</li>

          <li> Cook chicken breasts until golden on first side, then
          flip over. Cover the pan and reduce heat to medium, cooking
          until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 5 to 7
          minutes on the second side. Place on a plate and cover with
          foil until cool enough to slice into strips.</li>

          <li> In a large, deep-sided skillet, melt remaining 1/2
          cup butter over medium heat. Add garlic to pan, cooking until
          aromatic, about 30 seconds. Reduce heat to medium-low. Season
          with remaining salt and pepper.</li>

          <li> Whisk flour into butter, stirring until no chunks remain.
          Slowly whisk in cream.</li>

          <li> Continue to cook just until sauce is steaming and
          slightly thickened. Whisk 1/2 cup Parmesan into sauce,
          stirring until smooth. Remove pan from heat and cover until
          ready to serve.</li>

          <li> To serve, place pasta in a serving bowl or on plates. Top
          with sliced chicken and drizzle with sauce. Garnish with
          parsley and top with additional Parmesan, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
